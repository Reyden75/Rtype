# Getting Started

## Quick Start: Windows

Prerequisites:

- Windows 7 or newer
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) 2015 Update 3 or greater with the English language pack
- [VCPKG] [VCPKG: Quickstart Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start-windows)

First, download the project; it can be installed anywhere.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/EpitechPromo2025/B-CPP-500-PAR-5-2-rtype-alexandre.collin-betheuil.git
```

You will need to install the sfml package with VCPKG.

```shell
vcpkg.exe install sfml:x64-windows
```

Note: You can setup VCPKG as an environment variable to use it anywhere, else you will need to use the full path like that.

```shell
path/to/vcpkg.exe install sfml:x64-windows
```

Setup the VCPKG_DIR [environment variable](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/oml4r/1.5.1/oread/creating-and-modifying-environment-variables-on-windows.html) as path/to/vcpkg.

After this you can now open the cloned repository with Visual Studio, wait for it to build the project and launch the generated executable.

## Quick Start: Unix

Prerequisites:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- g++ >= 6
- [VCPKG] [VCPKG: Quickstart Unix](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start-unix)
- [autoconf libtool](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)

First, download the project; it can be installed anywhere.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/EpitechPromo2025/B-CPP-500-PAR-5-2-rtype-alexandre.collin-betheuil.git
```

You will need to install the sfml package with VCPKG.

```shell
vcpkg install sfml:x64-linux
```

Setup the VCPKG_DIR as an environment variable in the cloned repository.

```shell
export VCPKG_DIR=/path/to/vcpkg
```

Build the project with CMake.

```shell
cmake -B ./build/
```

Compile the project.

```shell
cd build/
make
```

Launch the binary.

```shell
./r-type_client
```
